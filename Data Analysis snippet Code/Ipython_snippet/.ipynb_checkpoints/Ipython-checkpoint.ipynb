    "# Logging the Input and Output\n",
    "IPython provides a feature that allows you to log your entire console session, including both the input commands you type and the corresponding output generated by those commands. This feature can be helpful for keeping a record of your work, documenting your analysis, or sharing your session with others. The process of logging the input and output is initiated using the `%logstart` magic command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Activating Logging**: To start logging your IPython session, you can type the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   %logstart\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   When you run this command, IPython will activate auto-logging, which means it will record both the current session's state and any future input you provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Logging Configuration**:\n",
    "   After you run `%logstart`, IPython will provide you with information about the logging configuration it's using. This includes details such as:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - `Filename`: The name of the file where the log will be saved (`ipython_log.py` in this case).\n",
    "   - `Mode`: The mode in which the log file is managed (e.g., rotate, append).\n",
    "   - `Output logging`: Whether output logging (result of executed commands) is enabled.\n",
    "   - `Raw input log`: Whether raw input (including whitespace and comments) is logged.\n",
    "   - `Timestamping`: Whether timestamps are added to each logged command.\n",
    "   - `State`: The current state of logging (active or inactive).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enabling and Disabling Logging**: You can enable or disable IPython logging at any point during your session. If you decide you want to save your entire session from a certain point onward, you can use `%logstart`. If you want to stop logging, you can use `%logoff` or `%logstop`. If you later want to resume logging, you can use `%logon`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Advanced Options**: The `%logstart` command has additional options that allow you to customize the logging behavior. For example, you can specify the filename for the log, change the log mode, enable output logging, include timestamps, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can find more information about these options in the docstring for `%logstart`. You can access the docstring by typing `?%logstart`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Companion Functions**: Along with `%logstart`, there are other related magic commands you can use to manage logging, such as `%logoff`, `%logon`, `%logstate`, and `%logstop`. These commands provide control over the logging state and options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that logging is a useful feature, but it can consume storage space if not managed properly. Use it wisely to document important sessions or experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with any IPython magic command, you can explore the detailed documentation by typing `?%command_name` to get more information about its usage and options."

    "# Interacting with the Operating System\n",
    "\n",
    "**Integration with Operating System Shell**:\n",
    "IPython provides a strong integration with the command line shell of your operating system. This means that you can execute various commands that you would normally run in a terminal or command prompt directly within your IPython session. This integration allows you to work with the operating system without having to exit IPython.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Shell Actions in IPython**:\n",
    "1. **Executing Shell Commands**: With IPython, you can execute shell commands directly from your IPython prompt. These commands are executed as if you were using a command line interface. This is achieved using IPython's built-in magic commands, which are special commands starting with `%`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Changing Directories**: You can use IPython to change directories within the current shell session. This is particularly useful when you want to navigate to a different directory without leaving the IPython environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Storing Command Results**: IPython allows you to capture the results of shell commands and store them in Python objects such as lists or strings. This means you can manipulate the output of shell commands directly within your Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Shell Command Aliasing**: IPython provides a feature called \"aliasing\" that lets you create shortcuts for commonly used shell commands. These aliases can help you execute complex shell commands using shorter and more memorable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Directory Bookmarking**: IPython also offers directory bookmarking, which allows you to create aliases for frequently used directories. This makes it easier to navigate to specific directories quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using Magic Functions**:\n",
    "IPython's magic functions provide a convenient way to interact with the operating system shell. Magic functions are prefixed with `%` and provide special behavior within the IPython environment. These functions enable you to seamlessly execute shell commands without having to switch to a separate terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Table 3-3**: The text mentions \"Table 3-3\" which likely provides a summary of magic functions and syntax for calling shell commands. Unfortunately, the content of this table is missing. However, it would likely list and explain the magic functions that allow you to interact with the shell, such as `%ls` (list files), `%cd` (change directory), `%pwd` (print working directory), and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this feature enhances your workflow by allowing you to seamlessly combine shell commands with Python code, making it easier to manage files, directories, and other aspects of your operating system from within the IPython environment. If you have any specific questions about the mentioned features or need further clarification, feel free to ask!\n",

    "**Summary: Measuring Code Execution Time**\n",
    "\n",
    "When working on larger-scale or longer-running data analysis tasks, it's often important to measure the execution time of different components, statements, or function calls. IPython simplifies this process by providing two magic functions: `%time` and `%timeit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Magic Function | Purpose |\n",
    "|----------------|---------|\n",
    "| `%time` | Measures and reports the total execution time of a statement once. |\n",
    "| `%timeit` | Runs a statement multiple times to produce an average runtime, providing a more accurate measurement. |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Usage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to compare the performance of two methods for selecting strings starting with a specific prefix from a large list of strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "strings = ['foo', 'foobar', 'baz', 'qux', 'python', 'Guido Van Rossum'] * 100000\n",
    "\n",
    "# Method 1\n",
    "method1 = [x for x in strings if x.startswith('foo')]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Method 2\n",
    "method2 = [x for x in strings if x[:3] == 'foo']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By using `%time` and `%timeit`, we can quickly gauge the execution times of these methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%time method1 = [x for x in strings if x.startswith('foo')]  # Wall time: 0.19 s\n",
    "%time method2 = [x for x in strings if x[:3] == 'foo']      # Wall time: 0.09 s\n",
    "\n",
    "%timeit [x for x in strings if x.startswith('foo')]        # Average: 159 ms per loop\n",
    "%timeit [x for x in strings if x[:3] == 'foo']            # Average: 59.3 ms per loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `%timeit` is particularly useful for analyzing short-duration statements, even down to the microsecond or nanosecond level. These seemingly insignificant time differences can accumulate, impacting overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the performance characteristics of libraries like the Python standard library, NumPy, and pandas is essential, as even small variations in execution times can have a substantial impact in larger-scale data analysis applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, IPython's `%time` and `%timeit` magic functions provide a convenient way to measure and compare code execution times. By analyzing performance characteristics, you can optimize your code for more efficient data analysis."

Specifying functions explicitly in `%lprun` helps reduce the overhead of tracing each line.\n",

    "# Profiling a Function Line-by-Line\n",
    "**Summary: Line-by-Line Profiling with `%lprun`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Profiling code execution is crucial for identifying performance bottlenecks and optimizing software. While traditional profiling methods like `%prun` and cProfile provide insights into function-level performance, complex code or the need for a more detailed analysis may require a different approach. This is where the `line_profiler` library comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Enabling the Extension:**\n",
    "To harness the power of `%lprun`, install the `line_profiler` package and activate the IPython extension by modifying your IPython configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "c.TerminalIPythonApp.extensions = ['line_profiler']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Use:**\n",
    "1. Define the functions you want to analyze within your module or IPython session.\n",
    "2. Employ `%lprun -f function_name statement_to_profile` to profile specific functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Example:**\n",
    "Imagine a module named `prof_mod` containing functions `add_and_sum` and `call_function` that operate on NumPy arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use `%run` to load the module and set variables.\n",
    "2. Profile the `add_and_sum` function using `%lprun`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%run prof_mod\n",
    "x = randn(3000, 3000)\n",
    "y = randn(3000, 3000)\n",
    "%lprun -f add_and_sum add_and_sum(x, y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `%lprun` reveals a detailed line-by-line breakdown of execution time for the specified function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Timer unit: 1e-06 s\n",
    "File: prof_mod.py\n",
    "Function: add_and_sum at line 3\n",
    "Total time: 0.045936 s\n",
    "Line # Hits Time Per Hit % Time Line Contents\n",
    "==============================================================\n",
    "3 def add_and_sum(x, y):\n",
    "4 1 36510 36510.0 79.5 added = x + y\n",
    "5 1 9425 9425.0 20.5 summed = added.sum(axis=1)\n",
    "6 1 1 1.0 0.0 return summed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing Profiling Tools:**\n",
    "- **Macro-Level Profiling:** Utilize `%prun` (cProfile) to gain an overview of function execution time and identify major performance hotspots.\n",
    "- **Micro-Level Profiling:** Opt for `%lprun` (line_profiler) for detailed line-by-line analysis, especially when examining functions with very short execution times.\n",
    "\n",
    "By having proficiency in both macro and micro profiling tools, developers can effectively optimize code and enhance overall software performance.\n"
